# bar

Bar is very much WIP, but it's coming out of a frustration with the existing ways I have to do Backups And Restores using 'star', 'tar' or 'dar' or even Bacula. The wishlist for bar is as follows

- To have a similar commandline-style interface to 'tar'. I've been using tar for 40 years and I like its simplicity.
- To be able to use compression on multi-tape archives. 
- To be able to quickly query archives for matches/file-info etc

Doesn't sound like much, but I can't find anything that will actually do that. So. Bar.
